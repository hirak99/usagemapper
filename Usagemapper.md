# Introduction #

This is a small utility written in CSharp to graphically figure out where all your space have gone. This project was heavily inspired by KDE project [Filelight](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=9887). To get the Windows binaries please visit the [download section](http://code.google.com/p/usagemapper/downloads/list).
